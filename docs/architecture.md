# Architecture

`NostrSeal/companion` is the untrusted host-side software shared by all signer
lines.

## Responsibilities

- Construct signing requests from Nostr event templates.
- Move requests over selected transports.
- Verify signer responses against `NostrSeal/specs`.
- Provide CLI and automated harnesses before browser or GUI workflows.
- Reject mismatched event ids, pubkeys, signatures, and request ids.

## Trust Boundary

The companion must not be trusted with production private keys. A development
signer may exist only as an explicit test harness.

## Implemented Modules

- `apps/cli`: command-line entrypoint.
- `packages/core`: NIP-01 event id and BIP-340 verification.
- `packages/protocol`: schema validation and typed request/response models.
- `packages/fixtures`: shared fixture loading.
- `packages/dev-signer`: test-only signing implementation.
- `packages/transport`: signer transport interface plus in-memory development,
  JSON file, and JSON-lines stdio adapters.

## Current CLI Flow

The M2 CLI flow is:

1. Build a request from an unsigned Nostr event template.
2. Produce a development response with an explicit software test key.
3. Verify the response against the original request before any downstream use.

The development signer exists only for local testing. Production signer lines
must replace it with a hardware, vault, or smartcard transport while preserving
the same request/response verification boundary.

## Transport Boundary

Every transport implements a single `exchange(request)` contract. Transport
adapters are responsible for moving JSON request and response envelopes only.
The companion remains responsible for validating request/response shape and
cryptographically verifying successful signed-event responses after transport
completion.

The current adapters cover three development paths:

- `DevSignerTransport`: in-memory test signer for deterministic harnesses.
- `JsonFileTransport`: file handoff for QR vault and offline workflow tests.
- `JsonLineStdioTransport`: one-shot process bridge for external signer
  adapters and future hardware simulators.
