# Architecture

`nSealr/companion` is the untrusted host-side software shared by all signer
lines.

## Responsibilities

- Construct signing requests from Nostr event templates.
- Move requests over selected transports.
- Verify signer responses against `nSealr/specs`.
- Provide CLI and automated harnesses before browser or GUI workflows.
- Reject mismatched event ids, pubkeys, signatures, and request ids.

## Trust Boundary

The companion must not be trusted with production private keys. A development
signer may exist only as an explicit test harness.

Before any production signer I/O, production browser-extension packaging, full
NIP-46 relay session, or file-backed persistent grant use is added, companion
code must pass the M4.5
pre-signing hardening gate. Signing-request validation, NIP-46 bridge
conversion, QR/serial decoding, and policy-file parsing must share explicit
nSealr v0 limits and deterministic rejection behavior. CLI commands should
only adapt file/argument I/O around package-owned validation logic.

The companion is infrastructure, not a first-class signer family. Per-solution
feature status lives in `nSealr/specs`
`vectors/features/signer-feature-matrix-v0.json`. When companion exposes a
feature used by multiple signer families, such as request validation, review
projection, policy decisions, transport framing, or response verification, it
must follow the shared `contract_id` instead of creating a host-only variant.

Browser extension, npm SDK, CLI, local app, local service, and full NIP-46
relay support are companion access surfaces. They must stay thin over
package-owned logic. In particular, a browser extension may expose NIP-07
`window.nostr`, but it must not store production signing material or implement
browser-local production signing. An npm SDK may expose reusable helper
packages, but it must not export test-only signing as a production path.

## Implemented Modules

- `apps/cli`: command-line entrypoint.
- `apps/browser-extension`: private browser-extension boundary scaffold. It
  owns strict internal message parsing and provider-backed request handling for
  `get_public_key` and `sign_event`, validates provider outputs before browser
  callers can trust them, derives sender-bound client identity before provider
  selection, can compose that identity with the native-messaging local-service
  provider path, can request digest-bound local-service pairing intents for the
  same identity, can project those intents into deterministic pairing and
  browser-origin permission review metadata without approving clients, and can
  create origin permission approval artifacts only after explicit local pairing
  digest confirmation. It has a pure background-controller boundary over
  injected native messaging with optional response timeouts and request-scoped
  cancellation, a pure runtime-message adapter that maps raw browser sender
  metadata into the internal sender shape before background handling, an
  injected runtime `onMessage` listener installer with explicit teardown and
  asynchronous `sendResponse` handling, and a pure page-provider boundary that
  maps NIP-07
  `getPublicKey` and `signEvent` calls to validated background requests, and
  has a pure page-bridge envelope and page-side requester adapter for future
  page/content-script messaging. It also has a pure content-script bridge
  handler for sender-bound background forwarding, a pure content-window event
  adapter for source/origin gating before forwarding, an injected
  content-window message-listener installer with explicit teardown and injected
  response posting, and a pure page-script bootstrap that installs the provider
  over an injected bridge exchange.
  It can build a minimal MV3 manifest with `nativeMessaging` as the only
  permission, and an opt-in explicit-origin content-script manifest profile
  that exposes only the packaged page script to those explicit origins while
  still omitting host-permission fields, broad URL matches, extension storage,
  grants, and key custody. It does not yet ship full extension
  packaging, automatic content-script/page-script injection, packaged
  bootstrap/config loading, native-host installation, permission UI, persistent
  grants, or signer dispatch. Its packaged runtime entrypoints are checked by
  source import hygiene and an esbuild browser bundle smoke before installable
  package generation is allowed. The first package-build CLI writes an explicit
  output directory only after successful in-memory bundling, embeds a
  digest-approved secretless static route config in the background bundle,
  returns a package digest plus per-file byte counts and SHA-256 hashes, writes
  no extension storage, installs no native-host manifest, and remains a
  developer artifact until a full bootstrap/config UX is reviewed.
- `packages/core`: NIP-01 event id and BIP-340 verification.
- `packages/protocol`: schema validation, typed request/response models, the
  central nSealr v0 implementation limit profile used by companion parsers,
  and signing-status consistency checks so a signer cannot claim
  `signing_enabled: true` while still reporting missing gates or
  `signing_enabled: false` without reporting at least one blocker. Gate lists
  are also checked for duplicates. Response request ids must follow the same
  v0 profile as requests, and signed-event responses are checked against the
  same integer-safety, content, and tag resource limits before transport or CLI
  callers can treat them as accepted output.
- `packages/fixtures`: shared event, key, trusted-review,
  review-display-frame, review-detail-page, QR review-transcript, NIP-46
  payload, NIP-46 policy-file, account-descriptor, policy-profile,
  grant-descriptor, policy-decision, feature-matrix, limit-profile, and
  invalid hardening fixture loading.
  Package code also owns QR review-transcript fixture validation, including
  `scroll` buttons and rendered-frame `body_line_styles`, so the CLI does not
  duplicate that contract.
  Package code also validates feature matrices so shared feature `contract_id`
  drift and Raspberry/ESP32 stateless QR vault target drift fail in companion
  conformance checks.
- `packages/policy`: secretless account, route, recovery, policy, grant
  descriptor parsing, and pure policy-decision evaluation. This package owns
  anti-secret, anti-QR-automation, anti-decrypt-grant, and audit-event decision
  checks so CLI code does not grow a parallel policy parser.
- `packages/review`: deterministic event-template review summary generation
  for untrusted companion previews and conformance checks.
- `packages/dev-signer`: private test-only signing implementation and
  development signer transport. It is not a production signer route and must
  not become a dependency of publishable production packages.
- `packages/transport`: signer transport interface plus JSON file, JSON-lines
  stdio, serial-frame, and serial-line adapters. It is intentionally
  secretless and does not depend on `@nsealr/dev-signer`.
- `packages/qr`: v0 `nsealr1:` QR envelope encoding and decoding.
- `packages/framing`: checksum-protected serial line framing draft with the
  shared v0 serial-frame byte limit.
- `packages/smartcard`: APDU codec, simulator adapter, provider-based PC/SC
  APDU transport boundary, `SmartcardSigner` boundary, and response
  verification for the display-less smartcard line.
- `packages/nip46`: decrypted NIP-46 payload bridge for `get_public_key`,
  `sign_event`, local `ping`, and conversion from nSealr responses back to
  NIP-46 result/error strings. It also validates requested permission strings
  and policy files, and parses `connect` messages into review intents and
  deterministic review pages for later policy work.
  Permission matching is present as a pure boundary and is pinned by shared
  permission policy fixture checks. Bridge decision output is also present: a
  permitted request can become a signer request, `ping` can produce a local
  response, `connect` can produce a review intent, and missing permissions
  produce deterministic NIP-46 errors before signer transport. Permission
  storage and grant UX remain separate layers.
- `packages/client`: local companion service request/response protocol,
  native-messaging frame codec, service status, pairing intent generation,
  shared local-client identity parsing, deterministic pairing-review
  projection, grant enforcement, a strict
  secretless JSON grant-store contract, digest-bound storage-location review
  and approval artifacts, secretless account-route selection, signer-request
  validation, grant-gated signer-request dispatch through an explicitly injected
  dispatcher, signer-response verification, response validation, and a
  high-level client wrapper. The wrapper checks request-id correlation,
  malformed responses, and operation-specific result types before callers can
  trust native-messaging responses. The dispatch operation remains unavailable
  by default and adds no real transport driver by itself. The package also
  exposes a route-aware dispatcher registry helper so host apps can attach
  multiple explicit account/route/transport handlers without putting
  route-selection conditionals in browser, SDK, or CLI access surfaces. This is
  the shared client/service boundary for future browser extension, SDK, and
  desktop work. The async service handler is the reviewed path for future
  host-owned signer drivers that need asynchronous transport I/O; the
  synchronous handler rejects async dispatchers deterministically.
- `packages/browser-provider`: NIP-07 provider adapter for browser-extension
  packaging. It accepts an injected companion backend plus explicit client
  identity, validates public keys, converts `signEvent` inputs into nSealr
  signer requests, verifies signed responses, and stores no browser-side
  production keys. Its local-service backend adapter can read the selected
  account public key through authorized route selection and routes `signEvent`
  through local-service dispatch, returning deterministic signer-unavailable
  responses until an explicit signer route dispatcher is configured. Its
  browser native-messaging adapter is intentionally thin: it validates the
  native-host name, calls an injected `sendNativeMessage`, and relies on
  `@nsealr/client` for shared local-service response validation, deterministic
  timeouts, cancellation, and request-id correlation.
- `packages/sdk`: public namespace facade for app, browser-extension, and
  companion integrations. It excludes private test signing from the public
  package surface, but browser runtime code must use reviewed browser-facing
  entrypoints such as `@nsealr/browser-provider` and
  `@nsealr/client/browser` instead of assuming the SDK root is bundle-safe.
- `apps/service`: private native-messaging host scaffold over
  `packages/client`. It processes multiple length-prefixed service messages on
  one stdio session, accepts explicit in-memory authorization context in tests,
  can load explicit storage-approved read-only secretless grant/account JSON
  context files for developer and integration harnesses, can load explicit
  storage-approved secretless route-driver stores for exact account/route/USB
  serial-line developer dispatch, returns deterministic native-frame errors,
  and can print validated Chromium/Firefox native-host manifest JSON plus
  digest-bound dry-run install-plan and install-approval JSON through the
  shared `@nsealr/client` manifest builder.
  It is intentionally secretless and does not yet install manifest files, write
  grant/account storage, perform production grant persistence, open relays, or
  include default or production signer transport drivers.

Each reusable package has its own `package.json`, source `src/index.ts`
entrypoint, and built `dist` JS/declaration export. Cross-package source imports
must go through `@nsealr/*` entrypoints, not relative paths into another
package's `src` directory. The repository verifier checks this boundary so
future extension, SDK, local-service, and CLI work cannot accidentally fork
validation or signing helper code.

## Access Surface Boundary

The intended access surfaces are:

- CLI: operator and lab harness over package-owned logic.
- Local companion service: future IPC/API boundary for browser extension,
  desktop UI, and high-level SDK clients.
- Browser extension: NIP-07 provider that forwards requests to companion and
  returns only verified results.
- npm SDK: public package set for clients and tools that need nSealr request,
  transport, policy, and verification helpers.
- NIP-46 relay service: encrypted remote-signer compatibility after session,
  grant, and policy contracts are ready.
- Desktop/operator UI: account, route, diagnostics, policy proposal, and audit
  surface over the same local service.

All of them must use the same request validator before contacting a signer
route and the same response verifier before returning signed events. None of
them may store production `nsec`, seed, mnemonic, passphrase, decrypted signing
material, or NIP-49 plaintext. Extension/session pairing data is still
sensitive and needs expiry, revocation, and origin/app binding before
production use.

Native messaging is the preferred first serious browser-extension transport to
the local companion. A localhost HTTP/WebSocket API remains research until
origin binding, CSRF protection, pairing, rate limits, and kill-switch behavior
are explicitly specified and tested. The M4.7 threat-model decision selects
native messaging for browser alpha because it avoids exposing an always-on
loopback service to ordinary web pages. Desktop, CLI, and SDK callers should
reuse the same local-service semantics rather than defining a separate security
model.

The first native-messaging scaffold accepts `service_status`,
`request_pairing`, `select_account_route`, `validate_signer_request`,
`dispatch_signer_request`, and `verify_signer_response`.
`@nsealr/client/browser` owns the browser-runtime local-service client
boundary, and `@nsealr/client/client-identity` remains the minimal
identity-only subpath. Browser extension, SDK, desktop, CLI, and native-host
code must reuse those contracts before deriving client ids, requesting pairing,
selecting account routes, or trusting pairing responses.
It rejects unsupported surfaces, non-origin URLs such as
`https://example.com/path`, deceptive localhost names, overlong app names,
invalid instance ids, and extra fields.
Pairing requests return a deterministic intent for later user review; they do
not approve the client. Validation and verification require explicit grants
supplied by the caller/test harness. When grant history is supplied, the latest
matching grant by `approved_at` wins, so newer revocation or narrower scope
cannot be bypassed by an older grant. Revoked, expired, missing, or
operation-scoped grants fail before signer payload handling. This lets browser,
SDK, and desktop code integrate against the authorization, validation, and
verification boundary before any signer I/O or persistent session state is
exposed. `@nsealr/client` now includes the caller-side wrapper for both object
exchange and native-messaging frame exchange; it validates service responses and
request-id correlation before returning them to higher-level callers.
The CLI `nsealr local review-pairing` command exposes the same deterministic
pairing-review projection for local/manual inspection. It validates the
digest-bound intent and writes review metadata only; it does not create grants,
approve clients, or write grant-store files.
The companion CLI also has `nsealr local approve-pairing`, which creates a
pairing approval artifact only after the caller supplies the reviewed pairing
digest. The artifact contains the approved grant metadata, but the command does
not append it to a grant store, choose storage locations, or contact signer
transports.
`nsealr local grant-store append-approval` is the first explicit grant-store
artifact builder. It validates a pairing approval artifact through
`@nsealr/client`, creates or extends a caller-supplied secretless grant-store
JSON object, and writes only a requested output path already covered by a
storage approval artifact. If an input grant store is supplied, the same storage
approval must cover that input as read-only. It never chooses a default storage
location, overwrites an existing output file, mutates the input store, approves
clients by itself, or contacts signer transports.
`nsealr local grant-store revoke-client` appends a latest-client revocation to
a new output grant-store artifact. Revocation is selected by
`client_id + origin + surface`, keeps prior grants in the history, and fails
deterministically if the storage approval does not cover the read-only input
and new output paths, if no matching grant exists, or if the latest matching
grant is already revoked.
`nsealr local review-storage` renders digest-bound review metadata for explicit
grant/account/route-driver store paths. `nsealr local approve-storage` then
creates an approval artifact only after the caller supplies the reviewed storage
digest. These commands require absolute, expanded, non-relative paths and
record read-only versus new-output access intent, but they do not choose default
paths, approve clients, dispatch signers, or turn reviewed paths into
production storage. Grant-store artifact builders consume those approvals before
writing requested output paths, and still refuse to replace existing output
files.
The private `@nsealr/service` app now runs a tested multi-message native-host
stdio loop, so a future browser extension can keep one native-messaging port
open and receive one deterministic response per length-prefixed service
request. It can also generate validated Chromium/Firefox native-host manifest
JSON, digest-bound dry-run install-plan JSON, and digest-confirmed
install-approval JSON with explicit host path, manifest path, extension id,
and reviewed install digest inputs through the shared `@nsealr/client`
manifest builder; the service app only owns CLI argument parsing and stdout
rendering for that contract. `@nsealr/client` also defines
the persistent grant-store JSON contract used to serialize approved and revoked
local client grants without secret material. The private service app can now
load explicit read-only grant/account context files for local harnesses only
when a digest-bound storage approval artifact covers those paths. It can also
load an explicit secretless route-driver store for exact account/route/USB
serial-line dispatch through the async local-service boundary only when the
same storage approval covers the driver-store path. That driver store does not
contain keys, does not approve clients, does not choose default paths, and does
not make QR vaults connected signers. Serial-line open, timeout, protocol, I/O,
close, and fallback failures are normalized into deterministic local-service
transport error codes before they cross the service boundary.
Install approvals still keep `writes_files=false`; manifest installation,
default storage locations, file writes, relay sessions, browser packaging, and
production driver acceptance remain separate gates.

The browser-provider package is intentionally one layer above this service
boundary. Each provider instance is bound to a client identity so the future
native-messaging backend can route pairing, revocation, and origin decisions
without inferring identity from unsigned browser data. It does not include an
extension manifest, native-host install flow, permission UI, account routing,
persistent grants, NIP-04, NIP-44, or relay sessions. It is the package-level
contract that a future extension will expose as `window.nostr`.
The first local-service backend adapter uses the same local-service route
selection and dispatch operations. It still returns deterministic
signer-unavailable responses for `signEvent` unless the local service host
injects a reviewed signer route dispatcher.
The package also includes a browser native-messaging local-service client
adapter over an explicit `sendNativeMessage(hostName, message)` function. This
keeps browser API integration thin while reusing `LocalServiceClient` response
validation, optional deterministic response timeouts, request cancellation,
request-id correlation, and the shared native host name and manifest contract
exported by `@nsealr/client`. Timeout and cancellation behavior lives in the
client package so SDK, browser extension, and future desktop callers cannot fork
that boundary.
It does not install native-host manifests, persist grants, or open signer
transports.
The background browser entrypoint adapter is the browser-like wrapper over the
background controller and runtime-message listener. It accepts an explicit
runtime object with reviewed `onMessage` and `sendNativeMessage` capabilities,
installs the runtime listener, and forwards native-messaging calls through the
same local-service client path. It now accepts either an already parsed route
request or a secretless `nsealr-browser-extension-route-config-v0` selected
account config that is parsed into a `sign_event` route request before listener
installation. It does not read global browser objects, write extension storage,
create grants, dispatch signers, or hold key material.
The packaged background source entrypoint
`nsealr-background-entrypoint.ts` is a thin launcher over that reviewed adapter:
it accepts an explicit packaged global scope, resolves an unambiguous
`browser.runtime` or `chrome.runtime`, requires the secretless route config, and
then installs the background listener. It still does not read extension storage,
create grants, dispatch signers, or hold key material.
The private `@nsealr/browser-extension` app now defines the internal extension
message boundary for `get_public_key` and `sign_event`. The parser rejects
unsupported NIP-07/NIP-44/NIP-04-style methods, malformed request ids, extra
fields, and unsafe event templates before provider handling. The first handler
is still browser-API-free and receives an injected provider; it validates
public keys, checks signed events against the original request, and returns
secretless deterministic errors for malformed requests or malformed provider
outputs.
The same app now has a browser-API-free page-provider boundary that exposes the
minimal NIP-07 `getPublicKey` and `signEvent` methods over an injected
background requester. It constructs only validated internal extension messages,
rejects unsafe event templates before contacting the background boundary,
verifies signed event responses, forwards cancellation signals, and can install
the frozen provider on an explicit target without overwriting an existing
provider. It does not inject content scripts, write browser storage, create
grants, or hold key material.
The page-bridge boundary defines a validated `page_to_extension` envelope over
the internal browser-extension request format and an `extension_to_page`
response envelope over the internal response format. It rejects malformed
directions, mismatched request ids, unsafe inner requests, and mismatched
background responses before a future content script can forward data across the
isolated-world boundary. The matching page-side requester adapter wraps
validated internal requests in that envelope, validates the returned bridge
response, forwards cancellation signals through the injected bridge exchange,
and rejects malformed input before the bridge is contacted. It has no
`postMessage` listener, no browser runtime dependency, no storage, and no key
custody.
The content-script bridge handler composes the page-bridge parser with an
injected sender-aware background requester. It binds each accepted page
envelope to the explicit sender object supplied by the future browser adapter,
forwards cancellation as a background request option, and rejects malformed or
already-cancelled page messages before the background is contacted. It has no
`postMessage` listener, no browser runtime dependency, no storage, no grants,
and no key custody.
The content-script runtime requester is a thin adapter for the real
content-script-to-background hop. It accepts an injected runtime-message sender,
forwards the validated internal request, combines bootstrap and per-request
abort signals, and rejects already-cancelled or in-flight-cancelled requests
without relying on global `browser`/`chrome` APIs. It still performs no
storage, grants, signer dispatch, or key custody.
The content-script runtime bridge bootstrap composes the injected window
listener with that runtime requester. It wires expected page source, exact page
origin, explicit sender metadata, injected runtime-message sender, injected
response poster, cancellation, and diagnostics into one install/dispose handle
without touching global browser APIs, storage, grants, signer dispatch, or key
material.
The content-script entrypoint composer is the pre-packaging adapter for the
future browser content script. It injects the reviewed page script through
explicit document and extension-URL dependencies, installs the runtime bridge
through explicit window/runtime/poster dependencies, disposes both pieces
together, and removes the injected page script if bridge installation fails.
It still does not call global `document`, `window`, `browser`, or `chrome`
APIs directly and does not write storage, create grants, dispatch signers, or
hold key material.
The content-script browser entrypoint adapter is the first browser-like
composition over that composer. It accepts explicit document, page-window,
location, and runtime-like dependencies; derives the reviewed page origin,
runtime URL resolver, runtime message sender, and response poster; and then
delegates to the pure composer. It still does not read global browser objects,
choose storage locations, create grants, dispatch signers, or hold key
material. Trusted runtime sender identity remains a background/runtime-message
boundary, not content-script metadata.
The packaged content-script source entrypoint
`nsealr-content-script-entrypoint.ts` is the matching launcher over that
adapter: it resolves document, window, location, and an unambiguous
`browser.runtime` or `chrome.runtime` from an explicit packaged global scope
before installing the page-script injector plus runtime bridge. It does not add
host permissions, browser storage, grants, signer dispatch, or key custody.
The content-runtime adapters are the next browser API boundary below that
composer. They turn an injected runtime-like object into a reviewed extension
resource URL resolver and a runtime-message sender, reject unsafe resource
paths before `runtime.getURL`, and reject already-cancelled sends before
`runtime.sendMessage`. They do not read or write extension storage, register
listeners, dispatch signers, or hold key material.
Page-window and content-window boundaries share one page-origin validator:
HTTPS page origins are accepted, local HTTP origins are accepted for developer
harnesses, and path/query/fragment URLs or non-page schemes are rejected before
use as trusted bridge origins.
The content-window event adapter handles one already-received window message at
a time. It accepts only messages from the expected page source and normalized
page origin, ignores unrelated data without responding, and forwards only
nSealr page-bridge envelopes to the content-script bridge handler. It still
does not register a `postMessage` listener, call `window.postMessage`, use
browser runtime APIs, write storage, create grants, or hold key material.
The content-window listener installer is the next thin adapter around that
event handler. It registers a `message` listener only on an injected target,
returns an explicit `dispose()` handle, posts accepted bridge responses only
through an injected response poster, and reports malformed nSealr envelopes
through an injected error callback. It still does not touch global `window`,
browser runtime APIs, extension storage, grants, provider injection, signer
dispatch, or key material.
The content-window response poster is the reviewed default poster for that
listener. It sends extension responses only through the `postMessage` function
on the accepted message source and only to a normalized HTTPS or localhost page
origin. It does not register listeners, touch global `window`, use browser
runtime APIs, write storage, create grants, dispatch signers, or hold key
material.
The page-window bridge exchange is the matching page-side adapter over an
injected window-like target. For each request it registers a temporary
`message` listener, posts the validated `page_to_extension` envelope only to
the exact reviewed page origin, ignores unrelated sources, origins, request
ids, and outbound envelopes, accepts only the matching `extension_to_page`
response, and removes the listener on response, abort, timeout, or posting
failure. It does not touch global `window`, browser runtime APIs, storage,
grants, signer dispatch, or key material.
The page-script bootstrap composes that requester with the NIP-07 page
provider and explicit-target installer. It gives the future injected page
script a single pure entrypoint while still requiring an injected bridge
exchange and still refusing to overwrite an existing `window.nostr` provider.
It does not include an injection mechanism, content-script registration,
browser runtime dependency, storage, grants, or key custody.
The page-script window-provider bootstrap is the page-side convenience wrapper
over the same provider installer and the page-window bridge exchange. It
installs the NIP-07 provider on an explicit target, posts through the injected
window-like bridge target, enforces exact origin and source filtering through
that exchange, and still contains no direct browser API dependency, storage,
grants, or key material.
The page-script browser provider entrypoint adapter is the browser-like wrapper
over that page-side bootstrap. It accepts an explicit page window and location,
derives the reviewed page origin, installs NIP-07 on that explicit target, and
uses the page-window bridge for requests. It still does not read global browser
objects, write storage, create grants, dispatch signers, or hold key material.
The packaged page-script source entrypoint
`nsealr-page-script-entrypoint.ts` is the matching launcher over that adapter:
it resolves the explicit packaged window and location scope and installs only
the reviewed NIP-07 page-window provider. It has no extension runtime, storage,
grants, signer dispatch, or key custody.
The page-script injection helper is the content-script-side DOM adapter. It
accepts only explicit document and extension-URL resolver dependencies, injects
the reviewed packaged page-script entrypoint resource as a module script with
a stable element id, rejects duplicate targets, unsafe script filenames,
unsupported URL protocols, wrong URL paths, and missing parents, and exposes
explicit teardown. Packaged extension filenames are intentionally distinct from
the internal pure modules such as `background.js`, `content-script.js`, and
`page-script.js`, so a future bundle cannot accidentally point the manifest or
page injection at a module that only exports helpers. It does not call global
`document`, `window`, `browser`, or `chrome` APIs directly.
The browser-extension package-plan boundary is a deterministic pre-bundling
artifact. It joins the reviewed manifest, packaged output filenames, and source
launcher paths into `nsealr-browser-extension-package-plan-v0`, then rejects
drift such as storage permission, host permissions, mismatched background
output, or mismatched content-script output. It deliberately does not build an
installable extension, install native-host manifests, write browser storage,
dispatch signers, or hold key material.
The private `@nsealr/browser-extension` app exposes this boundary through
`pnpm --filter @nsealr/browser-extension package-plan -- --target ...`, which
prints JSON to stdout only. The command has no output-path option and performs
no filesystem install or browser-storage mutation.
The `route-config-review` command first projects the selected account/route
into `nsealr-browser-extension-route-config-review-v0`, binding the exact
secretless route config to a digest without writing storage or approving a
client grant. The `route-config-approve` command turns that review into a
digest-confirmed approval artifact after the reviewed route-config digest is
supplied. Its `package-build` command then writes only a reviewed developer
artifact to a new explicit output directory after in-memory bundling succeeds
and the supplied route-config approval matches the embedded route config. The
returned `nsealr-browser-extension-package-build-v0` result includes a package
digest and per-file byte counts plus SHA-256 hashes so lab integration can
verify the files that were actually written. It still installs no native-host
manifest, writes no extension storage, creates no grants, dispatches no
signers, and holds no key material.
The same private app has a browser-API-free sender context boundary. The future
adapter must pass only sanitized `extension_id`, `page_origin` or `page_url`,
and optional reviewed app name. The boundary strips full URLs down to origins,
rejects mismatched origin/URL pairs, rejects deceptive localhost names and
extension-page origins, and creates the `browser_extension` local client
identity through `@nsealr/client/browser`. It stores no browser-side
production secrets and does not grant a page by itself.
The sender-aware handler composes both boundaries before provider selection: it
parses the internal request, validates sender-derived identity, and only then
asks the injected provider factory for a provider bound to that client context.
Malformed requests and malformed senders return deterministic secretless errors
without provider selection or signer I/O.
The runtime-message adapter is the pure boundary a future
`browser.runtime.onMessage` listener will call. It copies only sender id,
origin, and URL into the internal sender shape, ignores unrelated runtime
metadata such as tab or frame fields, validates the result through the same
sender parser, returns deterministic `invalid_sender` responses on sender
failure, and forwards request-scoped cancellation to the background controller.
It does not register browser listeners, call browser runtime APIs, write
storage, create grants, or hold key material.
It can emit `nsealr-browser-extension-pending-request-state-v0` snapshots
through an injected lifecycle for future visible pending/cancel UI. Those
snapshots expose only request id, method, extension id, page origin, optional
app name, status, and timestamps; they do not include event templates, key
material, grants, storage writes, or signer dispatch.
The runtime-message listener installer is a thin adapter over an injected
`runtime.onMessage`-like target. It registers exactly one listener, returns
`true` for asynchronous `sendResponse` delivery, sends deterministic responses
only through the injected responder, reports responder failures through an
injected error callback, and provides explicit teardown. It still does not
touch global `browser`/`chrome` APIs, extension storage, grants, signer
dispatch, or key material.
The origin permission boundary projects digest-bound local-service pairing
reviews into page-visible NIP-07 method effects and parses them before any
approval artifact is created. Approval requires the exact reviewed local pairing
digest, records the approved page-visible methods, and only authorizes a future
provider-injection step. It does not create local-service grants, write browser
storage, inject a provider, or contain key material.
Its manifest builder is intentionally restrictive: the default Chromium
manifest omits host permissions, optional host permissions, content scripts,
web-accessible resources, and storage; Firefox manifests require an explicit
reviewed extension id and otherwise follow the same zero-host-permission
boundary. An opt-in content-script profile may list explicit reviewed origins such as
`https://example.com/*` or local development origins such as
`http://localhost:5173/*`, but it rejects `<all_urls>`, wildcard schemes,
wildcard hosts, non-local `http`, duplicate matches, host-permission fields,
and storage. When content scripts are enabled, the manifest exposes only the
packaged page-script entrypoint as a web-accessible resource for those same
explicit matches so page injection can work without granting wider host access.
Origin injection and durable extension metadata remain blocked on permission UX
and reviewed browser-storage policy.

Executable SDK examples live in private app `@nsealr/sdk-examples`. They are
not another access surface and do not own production behavior. Their role is to
prove that a consumer can use the built public package entrypoints for request
validation, QR envelopes, local-service calls, browser-provider integration,
and already-decrypted NIP-46 decisions without importing private test-only
signing code or storing secrets.
The public package import-hygiene gate checks production source separately from
package manifests and tarball contents. It rejects `@nsealr/*` imports that do
not resolve to reviewed public packages or exported subpaths, rejects relative
imports that escape the package `src` boundary, and keeps private apps plus the
test-only signer package out of production package code.

## Current CLI Flow

The M2 CLI flow is:

1. Build a request from an unsigned Nostr event template.
2. Produce a development response with an explicit software test key.
3. Verify the response against the original request before any downstream use.

The same commands support JSON files and v0 `nsealr1:` QR envelope files so the
desktop companion can drive the Raspberry QR vault flow before camera/display
hardware is integrated.

`nsealr review-request` can render the same deterministic review JSON from a
JSON or QR `sign_event` request. With `--screen-review` it emits the
digest-bound screen-page model; with `--detail-pages` it emits the complete
constrained-display detail-page model used by Raspberry and ESP32 review UI
tests. Detail-page rendering defaults to the T-Display S3 sized profile and
accepts explicit title/body/compact line limits so lab and device adapters can
compare the same display envelope. These modes are deliberately labeled as
untrusted previews: they help users and automated tests see what a conforming
signer should display, but approval authority still belongs to the vault,
firmware, or card line holding the key.

The development signer exists only for local testing. Production signer lines
must replace it with a hardware, vault, or smartcard transport while preserving
the same request/response verification boundary.

## Transport Boundary

Every transport implements a single `exchange(request)` contract. Transport
adapters are responsible for moving JSON request and response envelopes only.
The companion remains responsible for validating request/response shape and
cryptographically verifying successful signed-event responses after transport
completion.

The shared transport boundary now enforces that verification before returning
from `exchange`: request shape is checked before sending, response shape and
`request_id` are checked after receiving, and successful `sign_event` responses
must pass NIP-01 event-id and BIP-340 signature verification against the
original request. Error responses such as `signing_disabled` can still return
as valid refusals.

Trusted-review vectors are loaded from `nSealr/specs` so host tools and
device implementations can agree on what must be shown before approval. They do
not make the companion trusted; they are conformance data for signer UIs.

Review-display-frame vectors are loaded and shape-checked as bounded rendering
contracts for small trusted screens. The companion treats them as conformance
data for Raspberry and ESP32 adapters, not as host-side approval authority.

Review-detail-page vectors are also loaded and shape-checked as complete
physical review-page contracts for constrained signer displays. They preserve
the shared `approval_digest` but pin scroll windows, line styles, continuation
indentation, visible JSON-style escapes for decoded control characters, and
explicit codepoint fallback separately from the digest-bound `screen-pages`
model. The companion can render these pages for previews and cross-repo
comparison, but still treats them as conformance data, not as a trusted
approval surface.

QR review-transcript vectors are also loaded and shape-checked by
`nsealr fixture verify`. They bind raw QR input to frame/button/decision
sequences for Raspberry and ESP32 adapter tests; the companion treats them as
conformance data, not as trusted approval authority. The transcript validator
lives in `packages/fixtures`, and `apps/cli` only calls it while iterating the
loaded fixture set.

NIP-46 payload vectors are loaded and verified by `nsealr fixture verify` so the
host bridge and shared specs agree on decrypted `get_public_key`, `sign_event`,
local `ping`, response mapping, and permission policy behavior before relay and
encryption work begins.

NIP-46 policy-file vectors are loaded and verified by `nsealr fixture verify` so
explicit approved-permission inputs stay normalized across specs, companion,
and lab integration. Package code owns the parser; the CLI only reads files and
passes parsed policies into bridge decisions. They are read-only conformance
files, not a grant store.

Account, policy, and grant descriptors are loaded through `packages/policy`.
The companion may keep labels, public keys, signer routes, recovery
descriptors, capabilities, policy ids, and scoped grant metadata. It must not
store production `nsec`, mnemonic, seed, passphrase, NIP-49 ciphertext, or raw
private key material. Stateless QR vault routes remain manual-only and cannot
receive persistent grants.

Route-selection vectors are also consumed through `packages/policy`. The
selector is pure and secretless: it accepts parsed account descriptors plus a
requested account/method and returns selected route metadata only. It does not
open transports, create grants, approve clients, dispatch signer I/O, or claim
route readiness. Route-selection request parsing also lives in `packages/policy`
so browser extension, local service, CLI, SDK, and future UI code do not fork
the selected-account route-request shape.

Those descriptors model the resulting signing public key and route. The
mnemonic, BIP-39 passphrase namespace, standalone `nsec`, device slot,
smartcard slot, or external bunker is a key source or route; policy attaches to
the resulting public key. Companion can prepare a policy proposal and transport
it, but a persistent nSealr device must review and accept authoritative
policy changes locally before they affect signing.

Policy-decision vectors are also consumed through `packages/policy`. The
current evaluator is pure and stateless: it accepts an explicit policy profile,
explicit grant descriptors, and an explicit request snapshot, then returns a
deterministic allow, deny, or manual-review decision plus a
`nsealr-grant-audit-event-v0` object. It deliberately does not create a grant
store, persist approvals, acknowledge NIP-46 `connect`, open relay sessions, or
contact signer transports.

The current scoped-automation fixtures are deliberately minimal conformance
data. They prove bounded decisions, denial, manual-review routing, revocation,
expiry, and audit-event shape before grant storage exists; they are not the
final product policy menu and should not grow into companion-owned rule-engine
state.

Pre-signing hardening vectors are the companion's rejection oracle for unsafe
input. They must be evaluated before signer transport, dev signing,
smartcard-sim signing, or NIP-46 routing can proceed, and failures must not
write output artifacts. The same invalid-vector suite also covers unsafe
signed-event response payloads so a real device output cannot bypass the v0
integer-safety, content, and tag limits after signing.

The current adapters cover these development paths:

- `DevSignerTransport`: in-memory test signer in private `@nsealr/dev-signer`
  for deterministic harnesses.
- `JsonFileTransport`: file handoff for QR vault and offline workflow tests.
- `JsonLineStdioTransport`: one-shot process bridge for external signer
  adapters and future hardware simulators. It bounds the pre-newline response
  buffer and captured stderr before returning or reporting process output, and
  terminates silent signer processes after a bounded response timeout.
- `SerialFrameTransport`: one-shot `nsealr1f:` request/response exchange for
  USB-serial, UART, and firmware smoke-test adapters. It treats
  `nsealr1f:error` as a transport diagnostic and includes the device error code
  in the thrown error instead of returning it as a signer response.
- `SerialLineTransport`: newline-oriented serial transport boundary with an
  injected port. It writes a validated `nsealr1f:` request frame, skips
  non-protocol device log lines, normalizes `LF`/`CRLF` line endings, rejects
  stalled writes and silent ports with deterministic timeouts, then returns
  through the same response shape, request-id, and signed-output verification
  gate as `SerialFrameTransport`.
- `SerialLineStreamPort`: dependency-free Node stream adapter for the
  serial-line boundary. It buffers chunked readable-stream output into complete
  lines, rejects any buffered line that exceeds the shared v0 serial-frame byte
  limit, writes newline-terminated request frames to a writable stream, and can
  close its underlying streams after failed exchanges.
- `exchangeSerialLineRequest`: package-owned one-shot serial-line exchange
  helper. It validates the request before opening a port, delegates exchange to
  `SerialLineTransport`, and closes the opened port in a `finally` block. CLI
  and future native bindings should use this boundary instead of duplicating
  validation/open/close sequencing.
- `nsealr serial-frame wrap-request` and `nsealr serial-frame unwrap-response`:
  offline CLI helpers for producing validated serial request frames and
  decoding validated serial response frames during ESP32 bring-up. With
  `--request`, response unwrapping also verifies the original request id and
  signed-output binding before writing output. These commands do not open a
  physical USB, CDC, HID, WebUSB, or WebSerial connection.
- `nsealr serial-line exchange`: one-shot local USB-serial CLI helper over
  `exchangeSerialLineRequest`. It opens a newline-oriented device path only
  after request validation, writes the chosen output format only after response
  verification, and is not a browser transport, relay session, persistent
  signer connection, or permission grant mechanism.
- `nsealr request get-capabilities`, `nsealr request get-public-key`, and
  `nsealr request get-signing-status`: host-side generators for non-sensitive
  parameterless device requests. They validate caller-supplied request ids
  before writing output and are useful for serial-frame hardware captures
  without involving signing.

## Smartcard Boundary

The first smartcard package covers the display-less APDU contract from
`nSealr/specs`: `GET_PUBLIC_KEY` and `SIGN_EVENT_ID`. It can protect key
material in a card-like boundary, but trusted event review must still happen
before the companion sends a 32-byte event id to a card.

`SmartcardSigner` models the companion side of that boundary. It retrieves the
card public key, computes the NIP-01 event id from the requested template, asks
the card to sign only that 32-byte id, verifies the returned Schnorr signature,
and emits the standard signed-event response. It refuses to sign unless the
caller supplies an explicit review acknowledgement. That acknowledgement is a
workflow guard for display-less smartcards, not proof that the untrusted host is
a trusted display. The display-less signer boundary therefore accepts only
`external-review` acknowledgement; any future trusted-display smartcard product
must be modeled as a separate trusted-review surface. External
`approvalDigest` input is mandatory, and the signer recomputes the shared
screen-review digest and rejects missing or mismatched values before APDU
exchange. It also reuses the shared request validator before APDU exchange, so
package callers cannot bypass CLI validation with host-supplied `id`, `pubkey`,
`sig`, malformed tags, oversized content, or other unsafe `sign_event` shapes.

`nsealr review-request --screen-review` renders the same deterministic screen
pages and `approval_digest` used by the shared vectors. `nsealr
smartcard-sim-sign` exposes the APDU flow through a test-only simulator and
requires `--approval-digest` whenever `--review-acknowledged` is used. Real
PC/SC and NFC transports must implement the same APDU exchange interface
without weakening the review acknowledgement requirement.

The PC/SC boundary is provider-based: tests can inject fake readers and future
desktop adapters can inject a real PC/SC provider without making a native card
driver a required companion dependency. It normalizes provider enumeration
failures, malformed reader-list results, and reader connection failures into
`PcscUnavailableError` before any APDU exchange, and normalizes APDU transmit
failures into the same error family after a connection is opened. It also
validates transmit-result shape, response status bytes, response data shape, and
numeric response data bytes before constructing response APDUs, so a malformed
provider response cannot be silently truncated or surfaced as a generic runtime
type error. It is not a real-card compatibility claim.

## NIP-46 Bridge Boundary

The first NIP-46 module handles only already-decrypted JSON-RPC-like payloads
from NIP-46 kind `24133` content. It does not implement relay subscriptions,
NIP-44 encryption/decryption, connection tokens, permission persistence, or auth
challenge UX.

The bridge maps `get_public_key` and `sign_event` messages into standard
nSealr v1 requests so any signer transport can handle them behind the same
verification boundary. `ping` is answered locally with `pong` because it does
not require a key-holding device. Signed-event responses are returned as
NIP-46 result strings containing JSON-stringified Nostr events; public-key
responses return the hex key string; nSealr error responses become NIP-46
error strings.

This keeps NIP-46 as a host transport/bridge layer. Trusted event review and
approval remain with the Raspberry, ESP32, smartcard-assisted, or future
hardware-wallet signer boundary.

Permission parsing is intentionally separate from permission grants. The parser
accepts the NIP-46 `method[:params]` string form, validates numeric
`sign_event:<kind>` selectors, and rejects `connect` as a requested permission.
The matching helper derives a required permission from a later request and
checks it against an already-approved permission set. A broad `sign_event`
permission matches every event kind; `sign_event:<kind>` matches only that
kind. Shared specs fixtures now include the derived requirement and
positive/negative permission checks for conformance. The bridge decision helper
uses the same matching result to produce signer routing, local `ping`, `connect`
review, or permission-denied responses. Actual grant storage, revocation, auth
challenges, and user approval UX remain future policy layers.

`nsealr nip46 decide` exposes that boundary as a file-backed test harness for
already-decrypted payloads. It writes the same deterministic decision JSON used
by shared vectors. The command accepts either an explicit permission string or
a read-only `nsealr-nip46-policy-v0` policy file pinned by shared specs
vectors. It does not create or update policy files, open relay sessions,
decrypt NIP-44 payloads, persist grants, or contact signer transports.

`nsealr nip46 review-connect` exposes only the review projection for an
already-decrypted `connect` request. It writes deterministic pages with the
remote signer pubkey, secret presence, and requested permission labels. It does
not echo the secret value, return `ack`, persist a grant, or authorize the
client.

`connect` parsing is also intentionally non-committal. The bridge can extract
the remote-signer pubkey, optional secret, and requested permissions into a
review intent and deterministic review pages, but it does not return `ack`,
echo secrets, persist grants, or authorize a client. A later policy layer must
review and explicitly approve that intent. The same boundary is now covered by
a shared `nSealr/specs` NIP-46 vector and `nsealr fixture verify`.

## QR Envelope

The companion follows the shared `nSealr/specs` QR v0 format:

```text
nsealr1:<base64url-json>
nsealr1a:<payload-sha256-hex>:<index>/<total>:<base64url-json-chunk>:<frame-checksum-hex16>
```

The static v0 envelope is deliberately uncompressed and single-part. The
animated v0 frame set keeps the same uncompressed JSON payload but splits the
base64url text across bounded `nsealr1a:` frames. Each frame carries the full
decoded JSON SHA-256 digest, a one-based index/total pair, and a short frame
checksum so receivers can reject missing, duplicated, reordered, or tampered
frames before parsing JSON. Compression and fountain codes remain out of scope.
The decoder enforces the shared static QR decoded JSON byte limit and rejects
padded base64url, invalid UTF-8, malformed JSON, and malformed prefixes before
any review or signing flow can consume the payload.
Animated decoding enforces separate decoded-JSON, frame-payload, and frame-count
limits from `nSealr/specs`, then still relies on request/response validation
to decide whether the reassembled payload is acceptable for the caller.

## Serial Frame Draft

The initial serial frame is one newline-terminated ASCII line:

```text
nsealr1f:<type>:<base64url-json>:<checksum>\n
```

Supported frame types are `request`, `response`, and `error`. The checksum is
the first 16 lowercase hexadecimal characters of SHA-256 over
`<type>:<base64url-json>`. This is not an authentication mechanism; it only
catches accidental framing and transport corruption before the companion applies
schema and signature verification.
The decoder enforces the shared complete-frame byte limit and rejects malformed
payloads before JSON parsing.
